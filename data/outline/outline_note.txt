Note:
This project uses two versions of shoreline point data:

only_measured_edgepoints.csv 
contains only directly measured shoreline points.

all_edgepoints.csv 
includes both the measured points and additional estimated shoreline points along the southwestern shore. 
These estimated points were assigned a depth of 0 m due to access restrictions in a nature reserve. 
The 0 m depth is justified by the fact that water level fluctuations in the lake regularly flood the adjacent bog area, 
making a defined shoreline edge unlikely in that section.
